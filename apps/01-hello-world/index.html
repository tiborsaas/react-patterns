        <p>In case you are wondering where this text comes from, it's in the index.html file except the hello world text above which is already rendered by React from a simple variable.</p>
        <p>Your React app needs a HTML node to be mounted to, which is completely up to you. Here I decided it to be the div with the #root id.</p>
        <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
